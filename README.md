# Fire-Detection
 
Fire Detection model using YOLOv3 algorithm trained on DarkNet framework.
The model was trained on custom annotated images of fire collected from web and frames extracted from videos.
The model currently provides an accuracy of 75% in detecting fire. The challenge lies in the fact that fire can be of any shape or size and at times may differ in color based on surrounding conditions. However the accuracy can be increased by using image augmentation techniques and increasing the number of images in the dataset.
